## What

Hello all,

A few people expressed interest in celebrating my departure (celebrating not commemorating), so this is the placeholder for that event. If the weather gods smile upon us it will be marked at a nearby pub with with nice outside space.

Also, I wouldn't want to presume who is interested in attending, so please share this calendar entry with others and 'Save' it, to add it your Calendar. No mass spam emails.

Thank you, look forward to see you there.

## Where

TBD - pub nearby
